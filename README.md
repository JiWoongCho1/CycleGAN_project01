CycleGAN very attractive structure for image to image translation.

So i feel very impressive and do the work for my fun!!!


Project object is that change the sex.


Using dataset that contains the various woman, man



## original man / woman

## translated man / woman

I think result is that not bad but not perfect.
My model seems to have learned the overall characteristics of women and men well, but I only changed the feeling from the existing image and did not change the delicate characteristics well. Recently, I saw a model for dressing clothes on YouTube, and there were various techniques for dividing areas such as image segmentation. In view of this, I think it would be better if each part was divided and trained rather than simply using a dataset.
